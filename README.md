```All my .py (Python files) are named according to their CTF category.
Web Exploitation->web
Cryptography->crypto
Reverse Engineering -> rev
Forensics -> fn6/(usually random though)
Binary Exploitation -> binja
```

I compete in a lot of CTFs but write like one writeup for each of them lol.
GoogleCTF will have full writeups though.
